# ECNN
This package uses adaptive evolutionary algorithms in order to train, evaluate, and evolve Convolutional Neural Networks. It includes a simple interface with TensorFlow and allows for parallel model training across multiple GPUs.

## Getting Started

The provided code uses the CIFAR 10 dataset as input. The can be downloaded [here] (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset should be saved in the 'datasets/cifar10' directory. Other datasets can be adapted to use the DataSet class provided in dataset.py.

Tournament defautls can be set in defaults.py.
